    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> <b>Halloweens</b> origins date back thousands of years to the Celtic New Years festival, <i>Samhain</i>. Samhain was a pagan religious celebration marking the end of summer and the beginning of the new year. However, it was not all cozy fires and warm cider. The <i>Celts</i> believed this was when the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead was thinnest, and all sorts of mischievous spirits roamed about.</p>

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">The modern-day Halloween is said to have originated from the <i>ancient</i> Celtic festival of Samhain, held around the 1st of November, the date that marked the transition from autumn to winter. It was at this time of year that people believed the boundary between the worlds of living and dead became blurred, and was when the souls of the dead were said to revisit their homes. According to many scholars, All Hallows Eve is a <b>Christian</b> feast influenced by Celtic harvest festivals. Initially, it was practiced only in <b>small</b> Irish Catholic settlements, until thousands of Irish migrated to America during the great potato famine and brought their customs with them.</p>
